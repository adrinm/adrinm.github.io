    <h1>Hi I'm Adrin, a UX and Graphic Designer located in Toronto, CA. 
        I’ve worked with incredible businesses — Designing <em>meaningful visual identities </em> that allow them to authentically describe their story through branding social strategies that help build awareness and engagement with customers around the world.</h1>
        <p>My career so far gives me fulfillment by learning a lot about different types of businesses. I love creating websites and have an eye for layouts, symmetry, and lines. I learned InDesign and Illustrator in my second semester of University, fell in love with creating, convinced myself that a great presentation grants you half of the YES for business, and never stopped ever since.</p>
        I love what I do and work hard to make sure people love it too. The feeling of changing someone's lives even if its as small as a laugh in the subway reading my ad in a newspaper is why I chose my career. Creating gives me a sense of purpose and makes me satisfied with the job I do.
        
        <p>We may not know each other (just yet), but if you’re reading this,</p>
        
        <strong>Nice to meet you!!!</strong>
